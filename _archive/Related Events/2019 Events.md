<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought that the event was very meaningful as we learnt about land use and the development of Singapore and how it will be our responsibility in the future. One thing that I learnt was that when considering what we will do with the land in the future, we have to take into consideration the needs of the people too"</em>

<p><em>"The event was fun and insightful for me. The idea of using Lego bricks to present our ideas was different from the usual classroom setting and kept me engrossed in the activities. I learnt that Singapore needs to use land efficiently and there are many interesting ideas on how to do so. If there are similar opportunities to learn about these issues, I would be interested to do my part"</em>
