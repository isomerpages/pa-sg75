<h2><strong>This Year's Theme (2022)</strong></h2>
<p>This year’s theme, <strong><em>Inclusive Singapore</em></strong>, invites
submissions in essays, pictures and motion media to express the social
cohesion of our community, and the building of an inclusive, sustainable,
and highly liveable society.</p>
<p><em>Erosion of social cohesion is the fastest-growing threat to our planet since the COVID crisis.<sup>1</sup></em>
</p>
<p><em>We must do our part to preserve it.</em>
</p>
<p>Rising divides, inequalities, opposing viewpoints on issues such as vaccines
and facemasks, and threats to global cooperation, contribute to create
disillusionment, fear and mistrust.</p>
<p><em>Singapore will not be spared.</em>
</p>
<p>Will Singapore Our Home, a City in a Garden, with its commitment to live
as a diverse society be ready for a post-pandemic future?</p>
<p><em>Our sustainable future is one that we build today.</em>
</p>
<p><em>How will your reflections shape the physical living spaces, social norms and culture of future Singaporeans?</em>
</p>
