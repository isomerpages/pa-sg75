<h2><strong>This Year's Theme (2020)</strong></h2>
<p>"The 20th Century was an era of unsustainable development... Our climate
is in crisis, nature is in crisis and populations are threatened with global
warming... Country or community, we must not only do well, we must do good
in relation to climate change."</p>
<p>â€“ Sir Mervyn King, world renowned corporate governance expert.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore is a very small country.</strong>
</p>
<p>The devastating effect of the Climate Crisis is a major threat to our
way of life - and the entire world. We would be severely affected as the
climate turns to the worst due to neglect, unsustainable development and
the day-to-day habits of all other inhabitants of our planet.</p>
<p><strong>By SG75, all we've built can be washed away if we're not prepared.</strong>
