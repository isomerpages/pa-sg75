<h2><strong>This Year's Theme (2021)</strong></h2>
<p>This yearâ€™s theme, <strong><em>Sustainability: Building Resilience and Inclusiveness in Fighting COVID-19</em></strong>,
invites submissions in essays, pictures and motion media to express the
strength of our community, emphasising the collective fight involving every
walk of society. Every person is vital to every solution.</p>
<p><em>COVID-19 substantially changed the way of life for people of Singapore and countries globally.</em>
</p>
<p>Singapore as a country has never faced a pandemic of this proportion.
The SARS virus of 2003 pales in comparison to COVID-19.</p>
<p><em>This may be a precursor of what is to come.</em>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 may not be the last major pandemic that will hit
Singapore or the world.</p>
<p><em>What is your vision and plan if it happens again? How will your reflections and experiences shape and encourage future Singaporeans?</em>
