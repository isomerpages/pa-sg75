<h3><strong>Ahoy, captain! Sail into the Future of Singapore with SG75 2024!</strong></h3>
<p>Bracing the tumultuous waves that mirror a challenging future, join us
as we learn to weather the storms with an indomitable spirit.</p>
<p>A plethora of uncertain environments may arise due to the changing seas.
What will our tiny red dot be like in 2040 due to our actions, and inaction,
today?</p>
<p>Waves beyond our shores may propel us toward a future variant that we
may not desire. How can we navigate resiliently against, around, or through
them? Will our hard-earned reservoir of trust, unity, and security be fortified
enough to carry every Singaporean into a defensible future? What can we
reinvent? How will we communicate with other stakeholders, especially organisations
or countries with possibly different ideals? Will our culture and heritage,
such as food and music, enforce strong community anchors to hold us together
despite strong headwinds?</p>
<p>We invite you to offer us a peek into the future you want to belong to;
even better, share some of the incredible milestones Singapore will achieve
and how we can continue to shine brightly in the future.</p>
<p>Think of it like a giant puzzle! Your job is to use words, colors, and
even digital means - think GenAI - to piece together a snapshot of what
our nation can be because of what we choose to do today.</p>
<p>Winning entries may be selected for exhibition at the Singapore Pavilion
at World Expo 2025 in Osaka. Selected entries may be required to be altered
to a format required for exhibition purposes. Judge's decision will be
final.</p>
