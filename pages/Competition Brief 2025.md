<p><strong>How can we design and build Singapore’s built environment to foster stronger, meaningful connections within communities?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We invite your students to explore this exciting question through art,
stories, and creative ideas in this year’s learning journey, held in collaboration
with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Singapore.</p>
<p>From homes and schools to parks and public spaces, Singapore’s built environment
is designed to enhance our daily lives. Over time, people form deep connections
and a sense of belonging, turning our physical infrastructures into familiar
spaces we call home. This contest encourages students to envision and express
how our built environment can bring people together and shape a future
where everyone belongs.</p>
