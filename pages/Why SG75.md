<p>In 2017, a group of like-minded professionals, youth and community volunteers
came together with a vision of creating a national level ideation and translation
platform to engage and challenge the members of public to dream about what
our collective Singapore future would be like in SG75 (2040).</p>
<p>The idea was inspired by discussions with Minister Indranee Rajah on how
we can ensure that the enterprising and creative spirit of our Founding
Fathers is inculcated in Singaporeans.</p>
<p>Our Founding Fathers faced unprecedented challenges in governing Singapore
from the word “go” in 1965 and they transformed Singapore into a city in
a garden since.</p>
<p>They overcame significant, almost impossible hurdles and existential challenges.
However, their foresight, discipline and ‘can do’ spirit triumphed.</p>
<p>Concerned that Singaporeans of today may lack this ‘fire in the belly’
as we enjoy the current good life and leave the thinking, visioning and
dreaming of tomorrow’s Singapore to a handful of decision makers – this
ground-up movement mobilises the masses to dream of a Singapore in SG75
(2040).</p>
<p>SG75 was chosen because it is far enough for us to envision and to make
good plans - yet near enough for us to see these plans take shape.</p>
<p>Much as Singapore has progressed over the years, some of the existential
challenges continue to exert their impact on us. For example, land use,
technology, water security, food security, climate change and the whole
host of new and old challenges.</p>
<p>If these challenges are not duly addressed, Singapore’s sustainability
and existence can be threatened.</p>
<p>Forward-looking and visionary will be what history will characterize the
Founding Fathers of modern Singapore led by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<p>Every generation will have to define what they stand for and build the
legacy for those who come after them.</p>
<p>Every generation will also need to be constantly embellished by the pioneering
spirit and tenacity of our Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>Let’s constantly be encouraged by the pioneering spirit and tenacity of
our Founding Fathers!</p>
